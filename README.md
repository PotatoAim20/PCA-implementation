# Image Compression using PCA

## Overview
This repository demonstrates image compression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for both grayscale and colored images. The process involves compressing the images, visualizing the compressed representations, decompressing the images, and visualizing the reconstructed images. The implementation avoids using built-in PCA functions and explores eigen faces for compressing groups of images.

## Key Features
1. **Grayscale Image Compression:**
   - Applies PCA to compress a grayscale image.
   - Visualizes the compressed representation.

2. **Decompression:**
   - Decompresses the compressed grayscale image.
   - Visualizes the reconstructed grayscale image.

3. **Eigen Faces for Group Compression:**
   - Explores eigen faces to compress a group of images.
   - Groups images based on common features to reduce redundancy.

4. **Colored Image Compression:**
   - Extends the compression technique to colored images.
   - Demonstrates PCA-based compression and decompression for colored images.
